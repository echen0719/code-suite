# üñ• Eric Chen's Code Suite - Learning Progress and Mini-Projects

Welcome to my this repository! Here, I will showcase my learning progress and projects in various programming languages and technologies. I've been dedicating time to mastering **Java**, **Python**, and front-end languages such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Within each language folder in this repository, you'll find a collection of my progress (<ins>Learning</ins>) and my mini-projects (<ins>Projects</ins>)

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- **Java**: Check out my work with Java projects, including problem-solving exercises and object-oriented programming practice.
- **Python**: Check out my work with Python scripts, applications, solutions, and more.
- **Front-End**: Check out my work with HTML, CSS, and JS. This section includes various web development projects and experiments.

Feel free to use, modify, and build upon any of the code provided here. I hope that by sharing my progress, I can help others on their coding journey and contribute to the open-source community. If you have any questions or feedback, contact me.
