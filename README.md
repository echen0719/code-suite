# üñ• Eric Chen's Code Suite

Welcome to my this repository I created for some reason... I've been dedicating time to mastering **Java**, **Python**, and front-end languages such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Within each language folder in this repository, you'll find a collection of my progress (<ins>Learning</ins>) and my mini-projects (<ins>Projects</ins>)

## üìÅ Repository Contents

**Java**: Me doing Cool Stuff (I hope)\
**Python**: Me doing Cool Stuff (I hope)\
**Front End**: Me doing Cool Stuff again (I hope)\
**Cool Stuff**: Me doing Really Cool Stuff (I hope)

Current file list:
