# üñ• Eric Chen's Code Suite

Welcome to my this repository I created for some reason... I've been dedicating time to mastering **Java**, **Python**, and front-end languages such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Within each language folder in this repository, you'll find a collection of my progress (<ins>Learning</ins>) and my mini-projects (<ins>Projects</ins>)

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- **Java**: Me doing Cool Stuff
- **Python**: Me doing Cool Stuff
- **Front End**: Me doing Cool Stuff again
- **Cool Stuff**: Me doing Really Cool Stuff

Feel free to use, modify, and build upon any of the code provided here. I believe in open sourcing of code. If you have any questions or feedback, contact me.
